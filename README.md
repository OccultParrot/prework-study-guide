# Prework Study Guide Website

## Description

This project was made to help memorise multiple languages importaint to web development, along with providing myself with study material for the Full Stack Bootcamp I am participating.

By writting this website I have learned 3 new languages! HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

## Installation

## Usage

Each box on the website holds some notes I took while completing the prework for the class. You can use these boxes to learn some *very* basic information on these 3 languages. Primarily the notes hold information on the basic use of the languages. There is also a section on Git, which holds some basic but necessary commands to use in Bash.
